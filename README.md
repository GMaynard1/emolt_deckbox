Raspberry Pi automated system 

Note: As of June 2022, this system is documented in an ever-changing googledoc so we do not attempt to duplicate that here.

Note: As of June 2022, the routines posted in this repository are for the OE-M deckbox. It consist of several routines (many of them first developed by Carles with some help from Joaquim in ~2022).  The original realtime system was first developed on the E-L deckbox by Huanxin and JiM in ~2015 is stored in  https://github.com/jamespatrickmanning/emolt_realtime/tree/huanxin but those are becoming obsolete.
